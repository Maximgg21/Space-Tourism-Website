                        A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used to 
                        carry a payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or 
                        beyond. Our WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful in operation. 
                        Standing 150 metres tall, it's quite an awe-inspiring sight on the launch pad!

                        A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching (or receiving) spacecraft, 
                        by analogy to the seaport for ships or airport for aircraft. Based in the 
                        famous Cape Canaveral, our spaceport is ideally situated to take advantage 
                        of the Earthâ€™s rotation for launch.

                        A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry 
                        capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where 
                        you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes a space gym, cinema, and 
                        plenty of other activities to keep you entertained.
